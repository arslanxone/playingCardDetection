# playingCardDetection
So, here is the code to detect the playing card. I used the logic of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-QPjO-2IkA 
Actually he wrote the code in Python I converted each and every step into C++. 
You can watch video of this code at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2kthSUPDN4  

Note:
To run this code you have to install OpenCV libraries and also extract cards_img.rar file and copy it according to the path used
in the code.
